SMS Spam Classification

Project Overview
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system helps in identifying unwanted messages and filtering them efficiently.

Project Structure
SMSSpam.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
SMSSpamCollection: The dataset used for the project. It contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham'.
OLd: (Optional) Backup or previous versions of the notebook and files.
.ipynb_checkpoints: Automatically generated checkpoints by Jupyter.# Datascience-project

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, SMSSpamCollection, contains two columns:
Label: The label of the message, either 'spam' or 'ham'.
Message: The actual text of the SMS message.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization are applied to the SMS messages to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Building: Multiple machine learning algorithms are used, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines, to classify SMS messages.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

How to Run
1.Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
2.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells in SMSSpam.ipynb.

Results
The system achieves high accuracy in identifying spam messages. The evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the models.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize the models to improve performance.
Deploying the model: Integrating the model into a web application for real-time SMS spam detection.
